Puzzle Pits is a classic 1995 DOS game from Plasmaworks.  Now it's here for you to play with, port, and anything you can imagine as it's made Open Source under the Apache 2.0 License. Feel free to contribute, fork and package this project.

This Open Source version comes without any warranty of being further developed or even being able to compile. It's just here as a way to make sure the code won't be lost in time.

Puzzle Pits has been made available with the permission of the original programmer and copyright holder (Abe.Pralle@plasmaworks.com).  If you want to build upon this code, I recommend that you fork this project.
